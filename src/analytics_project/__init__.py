# __init__.py
# This file is needed to mark this directory as a Python package.
# It can be left empty or used to set package-level variables.
# Python weirdness: package names use underscores, but project package names use dashes.
# 1. The package folder name must use underscores, e.g., py_starter.
# 2. The project name in pyproject.toml is the package name and must be the same, but with dashes, e.g., py-starter.
